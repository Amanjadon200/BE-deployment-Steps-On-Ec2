1. first create an ec2 instance 
2. connect it through ssh client 
    Open an SSH client.

    Locate your private key file. The key used to launch this instance is react1.pem

    Run this command, if necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable.
    chmod 400 "react1.pem"

    Connect to your instance using its Public DNS:
    ec2-**-***-***-***.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com

    Example:

    ssh -i "react1.pem" ubuntu@ec2-**-***-***-***.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com

    and run this command  (below command sytnax can change according to terminal below one is for CMD)
    rsync -avz --exclude "node_modules" --exclude ".git" -e "ssh -i ../../../.ssh/react1.pem" . ubuntu@ec2-**-***-***-***.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~/app
