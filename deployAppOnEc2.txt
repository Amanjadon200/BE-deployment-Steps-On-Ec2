1. first create an ec2 instance 
2. connect it through ssh client 
    Open an SSH client.

    Locate your private key file. The key used to launch this instance is react1.pem

    Run this command, if necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable.
    chmod 400 "react1.pem"

    Connect to your instance using its Public DNS:
    ec2-**-***-***-***.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com

    Example:

    ssh -i "react1.pem" ubuntu@ec2-**-***-***-***.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
3.  sudo apt update
4.  sudo apt upgrade // this will upgrade the packages and the security patches that recently pushed.
5.  curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
6.  sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
7.  if you are on windows then first install wsl by using this command
    wsl --install
    run command 
    wsl
    go to your project workspace in terminal it will look like this kind of (:/mnt/c/Users/username/Desktop/personalprojects/URL-Shortner-Backend-Server)
    and run this command  (below command sytnax can change according to terminal below one is for CMD)
    rsync -avz --exclude "node_modules" --exclude ".git" -e "ssh -i ../../../.ssh/react1.pem" . ubuntu@ec2-**-***-***-***.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~/app
    
    now through ssh you have connected just go to your service on ec2 like cd app then cd whatever your service name
    npm i
    npm start (start script should be in package.json-> kind of node index.js)

    but to ensure your node ec2 instance to keep running on ec2 even if you ctrl c (kill your teminal to exit from ssh connection)
    you should install pm2 in app directory
    sudo npm i pm2 -g
    then got to service 
    pm2 start index.js --name order-service
